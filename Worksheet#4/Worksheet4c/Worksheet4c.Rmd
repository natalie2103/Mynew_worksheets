#1. Use the dataset mpg
#a. Show your solutions on how to import a csv file into the environment.

```{r}
#b. Plot using the geom_bar() + coord_flip() just like what is shown below. Show codes and its result.










```

```{r}
#5. Plot the relationship between cyl - number of cylinders and displ - engine displacement using geom_point with aesthetic color = engine displacement. Title should be “Relationship between No. of Cylinders and Engine Displacement”.










```

```{r}
#a. How would you describe its relationship? Show the codes and its result.







```





```{r}
#6. Plot the relationship between displ (engine displacement) and hwy(highway miles per gallon). Mapped it with a continuous variable you have identified in #1-c. What is its result? Why it produced such output?

  traffic <- read_csv("traffic.csv")
  head(traffic)

```




```{r}
#a. How many numbers of observation does it have? What are the variables of the traffic dataset the Show your answer.

  summary(traffic)

```



```{r}
#b. subset the traffic dataset into junctions. What is the R codes and its output?

  juncset <- subset[traffic$Junction==]
  juncset


```


```{r}
#c. Plot each junction in a using geom_line(). Show your solution and output.


  library(readxl)
  alexa_file <- read_excel("alexa_file.xlsx")
  head(alexa_file)
  

```

```{r}
#7. From alexa_file.xlsx, import it to your environment.
#a. How many observations does alexa_file has? What about the number of columns? Show your solution and answer.

  str(alexa_file)

#The number of observations is 3,150 and The number of columns is 5. 

```

```{r}
#b. group the variations and get the total of each variations. Use dplyr package. Show solution and answer.




```

```{r}
#c. Plot the variations using the ggplot() function. What did you observe? Complete the details of the graph. Show solution and answer.




```
